# Chatbot using Python

This code is an implementation of a simple chatbot using TensorFlow, a machine learning framework developed by Google. The chatbot is trained to recognize user intents based on predefined patterns and provide appropriate responses.

Libraries and their purposes:

1. numpy: A library for numerical computing, numpy is used for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations efficiently.

2. tensorflow: An open-source machine learning framework, tensorflow is utilized for building, training, and deploying neural networks. In this chatbot, tensorflow is used for training the model to recognize user intents.

3. nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit, nltk is a library used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. It provides essential tools and resources for processing text data.

4. nltk.download('wordnet'): This command downloads the WordNet corpus from NLTK, which is necessary for lemmatization. Lemmatization is a process used to reduce words to their base or root form, enabling better understanding and analysis of text data.

Purpose of adjusting file paths:

Adjusting the file paths ensures that the code can locate and access the required files correctly. In this case, it ensures that the code can access the intents.json file, which contains predefined patterns and responses used for training the chatbot.

Execution order of Python files:

1. Read Readme1.txt for general information about the project.
2. Read Readme2.txt for additional instructions or details.
3. Execute new.py first to preprocess the data and train the chatbot model. This script prepares the data, trains the neural network model using TensorFlow, and saves the trained model for later use.
4. Execute chatbot.py to run the chatbot and interact with it. This script loads the trained model, accepts user input, recognizes intents, and provides appropriate responses.

Encouragement for code customization:

Users are encouraged to review and modify the code as needed to adapt it to their specific requirements. This may include customizing the intents.json file with additional patterns and responses, adjusting the training parameters, or enhancing the chatbot's functionality based on specific use cases.
