To run the chatbot, follow the steps below:

1.Open Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to the folder where the chatbot code is saved.

2. Type the following command to create a virtual environment:-
"python -m venv <folder_name_to_create>"
(Replace <folder_name_to_create> with the desired name for your virtual environment.)

3. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:-
"<folder_name>\Scripts\activate"
If the above command doesn't work, try specifying the full path to the folder:-
"<folder_path>\<folder_name>\Scripts\activate"

After activation, you should see the virtual environment name in parentheses along with the working directory, for example:

(<folder_name>) <working_directory>
On my system, the command looks like this: (chatbot) E:\Python>

Now, open the Readme2.txt file and correct any mistakes or provide additional instructions as needed.
